```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

To use the app the following inputs are required:

- prediction matrix: each row is a model point, each column the predictions
for one observable
- inverse covariance matrix
- parameter value matrix: each row is a model point, each column gives the
values of one parameter (columns need to be named)
- vector of experimentally observed values (alternatively these could be
predictions for a selected reference point)

Optionally, the user can also supply a coordinate matrix (same format as the
prediction matrix) and a distance matrix.
